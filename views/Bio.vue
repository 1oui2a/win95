        <h3 class="underline font-bold text-md pb-1">About Me</h3>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            I‚Äôm a {{ new Date().getFullYear() - 2001 }} year old Computing and Digital Media graduate with a passion for all things creative, from graphic design and front-end 
            web development to 3D and motion work. I enjoy exploring design in many forms, whether it‚Äôs building clean, interactive 
            websites, experimenting with visuals and animations in Blender or creating video edits of my current interests. I‚Äôm proficient in Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects) 
            and also work with DaVinci Resolve for video editing. 
            At my core, I love combining technology and creativity to bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            I thrive on staying updated with the latest design trends and development frameworks across all platforms. 
            While my heart lies in the design aspect, I am also proficient in cross-platform app and web development.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
           I am also extremely interested and passionate about game design. I am currently working on a 2D pixel idle game in my free time using
           Blender for 3D models, aseprite for the pixel art and unity with C# for the game development. Game dev and design can incoporate so many things
           which is why I love it.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            Most of my inspiration comes from actually being outside in the world. Touching grass some might say. Seeing the ways the colours reflect in puddles,
            how the birds chirp at each other, or simply enjoying a walk with music in switches something in my brain.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            My main hobbies include fashion, gaming, and creating, whether its digital art or traditional. Who could have guessed.
